2.
As a player, 
I want to be able to choose a role (operative or spymaster) after starting the game, 
So that I can actively participate in the game according to my preferred role.
```
```
3.
As an operative role player, 
I want to see a list of words relevant to my role during the game, 
So that I can interact with them by clicking on them to mark them as chosen.
```
```
4.
As a spymaster role player, 
I want to view a list of all words in the game along with color-coded borders indicating their affiliations,
So that I can strategize and provide clues to my team without interacting with the words directly.
```

As a user, 
I want the option to continue playing with a new game after finishing the current one, 
So that I can enjoy multiple rounds of the game without interruption.
```
